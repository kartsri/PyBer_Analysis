# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the new PyBer Analysis was to understand the summary statistics of the PyBer data by city type. Additionally, the analysis provided insights on average weekly fares for each city type, along with metrics like average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

## Results
Urban cities largest total rides, total drivers, and total fares. This is unsurprising given the large disparity in population between urban, subarban, and rural cities.

However, rural cities  had the highest average fare per driver, as well as the highest average fare per ride by significant margins.



When analyzing the total fare per city type plot, it is abundantly clear that urban fares in sum greatly outnumber the total fares for rural and suburban cities.

## Summary
To address the disparities among city types, I recommend the following actions:
* Slightly reduce rural fares to increase the volume of rides. Reducing the average fare may result in higher total fares, if more riders request PyBers.
* Slightly increase urban fares to increase the total fares captured from ubran cities.
* Decrease fares marginally in weeks where there are dips in each city type to incentivize higher usage. Increase fares marginally in weeks where there are spikes in each city type's fares to capitalize on high-demand seasons.
